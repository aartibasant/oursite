    ## we are trying to define how our Home should look with the url pattern below
    # oursite.views.home: In oursite there is views. In views there is some object/file/folder called home
    # So my code has folder oursite with file views.py with function home which will define what my home page
    url(r'^$', 'oursite.views.home', name='home'), # Home view
